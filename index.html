      <p> There once was a dog with a big black fox<br> They ate and they ran they went trot trot trot</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px;"> If the fox chose to eat the dog than dogs would than be afraid of cats. This is because even though the stereotype is that all cats are afraid of dogs. The fox which is a relative of the cats eats a dog, therefore making the other predatorial species afraid.</p>
